# Image Sorter

This script sorts images based on their tags. It sorts the images into different folders based on the most common tags as well as additional tags provided by the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

The script also requires the following Python libraries:
* tkinter
* os
* shutil
* re
* time
* collections
* tqdm

These can be installed using pip, Python's package installer. If you have Python installed, you should already have pip. To install the libraries, you can use the following command:
